## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Mongo DB
- Express JS
- Node js
- CSS
- Vanila JavaScript

### What I learned

- Showing data in chart form without external library like chart.js

### Continued development

- I want to hide the values written on bars. rather I want to show them when user hover on specific bar.
